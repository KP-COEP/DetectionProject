The proliferation of CCTV cameras calls for automated video analysis to infer interesting events from surveillance videos. Timely detection of suspicious/ anomalous events from videos is the need of the hour for safeguarding and monitoring the public places. This project performs near-real time detection and localization of anomalous events from surveillance videos using deep learning techniques based on CNNs, LSTM. The task of anomalous event detection is modeled as one class classification problem.
